## About
I am an AI Engineer focused on building reliable, verifiable LLM systems for real-world use cases.
My work centers around Hybrid RAG architectures combining dense vector retrieval with graph-based reasoning to reduce hallucinations.
I care about systems that work in production — not demos.
My background spans Machine Learning, AI models, Databases, and full-stack prototyping. I enjoy turning complex research concepts into practical systems—whether that’s building scalable retrieval pipelines, visualizing large knowledge graphs, or deploying ML-powered applications.
